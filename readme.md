# Gem-rs

Gem-rs is a Rust library that serves as a wrapper around the Gemini API, providing support for streaming. This library is designed to facilitate interaction with the Gemini API, making it easier to integrate its functionalities into Rust projects. Future updates will include support for uploading files and images, as well as caching files to Gemini.
